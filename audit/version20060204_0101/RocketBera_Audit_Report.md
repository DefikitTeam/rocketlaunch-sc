- MEDIUM: Issues that could cause problems under specific circumstances
- LOW: Minor issues and recommendations for code improvement

## Key Findings Summary
- 3 CRITICAL findings
- 2 HIGH risk findings 
- 3 MEDIUM risk findings
- 4 LOW risk findings

## Detailed Findings

### [CRITICAL-1] Reentrancy Vulnerability in sell() Function
**Location**: `sell()` function

The `sell()` function performs ETH transfers before updating state variables, making it vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. An attacker could recursively call the function through a malicious contract before state updates occur.

**Recommendation**:
Follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern by:
1. Performing all state updates before external calls
2. Moving the ETH transfers to the end of the function

```solidity
function sell(address poolAddress, uint256 batchNumber) public nonReentrant {
// ... validation checks ...
// 1. State updates
pool.reserveETH = pool.reserveETH.sub(amountETH);
pool.reserveBatch = pool.reserveBatch.add(batchNumber);
pool.soldBatch = pool.soldBatch.sub(batchNumber);
pool.raisedInETH = pool.raisedInETH.sub(amountETH);
user.balanceSold = user.balanceSold.add(batchNumber);
user.balance = user.balance.sub(batchNumber);
user.ethBought = user.ethBought.sub(amountETH);
// 2. External calls
payable(feeAddress).transfer(amountETH.div(100));
payable(msg.sender).transfer(amountForUser);
}
```

### [CRITICAL-2] Price Manipulation Vulnerability
**Location**: `getAmountOut()` and `getAmountIn()` functions

The price calculation functions are vulnerable to price manipulation through flash loans or large trades. The current implementation lacks price manipulation resistance mechanisms.

**Impact**:
- Attackers can manipulate prices to their advantage
- Users might receive significantly fewer tokens than expected

**Recommendation**:
1. Implement price oracle integration
2. Add slippage protection
3. Consider using TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price)

```solidity
function getAmountOut(
    uint256 amountIn,
    uint256 reserveIn,
    uint256 reserveOut,
    uint256 maxSlippage
) public pure returns (uint256 amountOut) {
    require(amountIn > 0, "INSUFFICIENT_INPUT_AMOUNT");
    require(reserveIn > 0 && reserveOut > 0, "INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY");
    
    uint256 amountWithFee = amountIn.mul(997);
    uint256 numerator = amountWithFee.mul(reserveOut);
    uint256 denominator = reserveIn.mul(1000).add(amountWithFee);
    amountOut = numerator / denominator;
    
    require(amountOut >= amountIn.mul(maxSlippage).div(10000), "Excessive slippage");
    return amountOut;
}
```

### [CRITICAL-3] Lack of Access Control in Critical Functions
**Location**: Multiple functions including `finalize()`, `activePool()`

Several critical functions have insufficient access controls or can be called in incorrect states.

**Recommendation**:
1. Implement proper role-based access control
2. Add state validation
3. Use modifiers for common checks

```solidity
modifier onlyPoolOwner(address poolAddress) {
    require(ownerToken[poolAddress] == msg.sender, "Not pool owner");
    _;
}

modifier validPoolState(address poolAddress, StatusPool requiredStatus) {
    require(pools[poolAddress].status == requiredStatus, "Invalid pool state");
    _;
}

function finalize(address poolAddress) public 
    onlyPoolOwner(poolAddress) 
    validPoolState(poolAddress, StatusPool.FULL) 
{
    // ... implementation
}
```

### [HIGH-1] Unbounded Loop in transferTokenUsers()
**Location**: `transferTokenUsers()` function

The function processes users in batches but could still hit gas limits with large arrays.

**Impact**:
- Function may become unusable with many users
- Potential DOS vulnerability

**Recommendation**:
```solidity
function transferTokenUsers(
    address tokenAddress,
    uint256 startIndex,
    uint256 batchSize
) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE) {
    require(batchSize <= 100, "Batch size too large");
    require(
        pools[tokenAddress].status == StatusPool.FINISHED,
        "Pool not finished"
    );
    
    uint256 endIndex = Math.min(
        startIndex.add(batchSize),
        buyerArr[tokenAddress].length
    );
    
    for (uint256 i = startIndex; i < endIndex; i++) {
        _claimTokenByUser(buyerArr[tokenAddress][i], tokenAddress);
    }
}
```

### [HIGH-2] Precision Loss in Farming Calculations
**Location**: `updateFarmingPool()` function

The farming calculations use fixed-point arithmetic with potential precision loss.

**Recommendation**:
```solidity
// Use higher precision
uint256 private constant PRECISION_FACTOR = 1e18;

function updateFarmingPool(address poolAddress) private {
    Farm storage farm = farms[poolAddress];
    if (block.number <= farm.lastRewardBlock) return;
    
    uint256 supply = pools[poolAddress].soldBatch;
    if (supply == 0) {
        farm.lastRewardBlock = block.number;
        return;
    }
    
    uint256 multiplier = block.number.sub(farm.lastRewardBlock);
    uint256 reward = multiplier.mul(farm.rewardPerBlock);
    farm.accTokenPerShare = farm.accTokenPerShare.add(
        reward.mul(PRECISION_FACTOR).div(supply)
    );
    farm.lastRewardBlock = block.number;
}
```

### [MEDIUM-1] Timestamp Dependence
**Location**: Multiple time-dependent functions

The contract relies heavily on `block.timestamp` for critical timing decisions.

**Recommendation**:
1. Use block numbers where possible
2. Add buffer periods for time-sensitive operations
```solidity
uint256 private constant TIME_BUFFER = 15 minutes;

function activePool(ActivePoolParams memory params) public {
    require(
        params.startTime > block.timestamp + TIME_BUFFER,
        "Start time too close"
    );
    // ... rest of the function
}
```

### [MEDIUM-2] Lack of Event Emission
**Location**: Multiple state-changing functions

Many state-changing functions don't emit events, making it difficult to track changes off-chain.

**Recommendation**:
```solidity
event PoolStateUpdated(
    address indexed pool,
    StatusPool oldStatus,
    StatusPool newStatus
);

event FarmingRewardUpdated(
    address indexed pool,
    uint256 oldReward,
    uint256 newReward
);

event UserStateUpdated(
    address indexed user,
    address indexed pool,
    uint256 oldBalance,
    uint256 newBalance
);
```

### [MEDIUM-3] Insufficient Input Validation
**Location**: Multiple functions

Many functions lack comprehensive input validation.

**Recommendation**:
```solidity
function activePool(ActivePoolParams memory params) public {
    require(params.token != address(0), "Invalid token address");
    require(params.tokenPerPurchase > 0, "Invalid token per purchase");
    require(params.maxRepeatPurchase > 0, "Invalid max repeat purchase");
    require(
        params.minDurationSell < params.maxDurationSell,
        "Invalid duration settings"
    );
    // ... rest of the function
}
```

### [LOW-1] Missing Documentation
- Add comprehensive NatSpec comments
- Document complex calculations
- Add inline comments for clarity

### [LOW-2] Gas Optimization Issues
- Cache frequently accessed storage variables
- Use unchecked blocks for safe arithmetic
- Optimize struct packing

### [LOW-3] Code Style Inconsistencies
- Standardize error messages
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Follow Solidity style guide

### [LOW-4] Missing Zero Address Checks
- Add zero address validation for all address parameters
- Implement safe transfer checks

## Recommendations Summary
1. Implement all CRITICAL and HIGH risk fixes before deployment
2. Add comprehensive testing for edge cases
3. Improve documentation and comments
4. Add proper event emissions
5. Implement proper access control
6. Add input validation
7. Consider professional audit before mainnet deployment

## Conclusion
The RocketBera contract contains several critical security issues that must be addressed before deployment. The most serious concerns are the reentrancy vulnerabilities, price manipulation risks, and access control issues. We strongly recommend implementing all suggested fixes and conducting another audit after the changes.
